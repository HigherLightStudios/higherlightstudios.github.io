            <p> Yes, I know listening to some stranger’s story of how they got their first laptop is boring and blah blah blah, but please try to keep attention. </p>
<p> When I was around five years old, my dad got me my first computer. More of a laptop than a computer. It was super slow and I played the OG games like the ones on Big Fish. Remember that app thingy? Yeesh that was long ago. Anyway, I played these simple games for a while and started to hear about this game… called Minecraft. My cousins played Minecraft: PE (the very old version, I can still remember there being just like 5 spawn eggs in creative) This was the main aspiration for the game I love today. </p>
<p> Fast forward playing a lot of good games, one which stands out to me, Subnautica. Gameplay was great and I played it for hundreds of hours. You know that game that’s just so good you finish the ending like four times? Yea this was one of it. </p>
<p> Another extravagant game (hope I spelled this correctly) was Thief Simulator, also played it non stop for like two weeks. Best two weeks of my life I think. And last but not least… Grand Theft Auto: Five! I probably finished this game five times. </p>
<p>There was a time in my life where I came up with ideas on games, and “tried” them in real life. I was a stupid kid playing around the house creating this game idea in my head and it’s story. And all the mechanics that come with it. It was fun, until it lost it’s spirit when I grew older. </p>
<p>I had this urge to make my own videogame that was fun or scary for others to play. I wanted to make a difference in people’s lives, and I hope to create a game people can play non stop. The “Golden Game”. The one that’ll either give me millions, or just really satisfy some people. </p>
<p>People do not realise the impact videogames have on us. How gamers are almost united as one and can understand eachother easily. Videogames helps us connect with people on a whole other level. And for that, I will one day give the opportunity for anyone to connect with others, on this wide spectrum we call… Games. </p>
